As a part of my school curriculum I had learnt JAVA programming using BlueJ in grade 9 and 10. I was absolutely in love with programming.
However in those two years, I did find some loopholes in the current system of teaching. Therefore over my summer break I decided to coach some students who were starting out in this world of programming.
