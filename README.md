As a part of my school curriculum I had learnt JAVA programming using BlueJ in grade 9 and 10. I was absolutely in love with programming.
However in those two years, I did find some loopholes in the current system of teaching. Therefore over my summer break I decided to coach some students who were starting out in this world of programming.In my webinar stretching over 4 weeks , I walked them through the basics of JAVA programming keeping in mind the school curriculum as well as the basic coding skills to get started.
Here are a few codes that I went over in my webinars. Hope you find it resourceful.
